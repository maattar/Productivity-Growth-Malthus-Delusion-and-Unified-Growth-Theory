Replication Files for "Productivity Growth, Malthus Delusion, and Unified Growth Theory"

This is a README file for the replication of results presented in “Productivity Growth, Malthus Delusion, and Unified Growth Theory.”
The main folder contains three sub-folders, i.e.,

1. Benchmark,
2. HigherAlpha, and
3. LongerRun,

that produce Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3, respectively. 

In each sub-folder, there exist four .m files that run the main program (i) for three productivity growth specifications and (ii) for the no-growth case. These files save the output into corresponding .mat files. Finally, those files ending with "_Figure" draw the figures.
